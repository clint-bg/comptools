With linear systems of equations, there is typically a unique solution that is easy to solve, even for large-scale systems. Nonlinear equations can be more challenging to solve and may have multiple solutions. Variable bounds and a good initial guess are sometimes required for nonlinear systems of equations.

That Psat function should be written such that all the parameters except for the temperature are defined by self. That is, def Psat(self,T): and then the function should return the vapor pressure referring to the self.antione coefficients in the function.\n",
