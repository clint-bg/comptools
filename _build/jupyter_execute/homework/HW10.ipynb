    "In the lecture we used a while loop to estimate the probability of a random walk ending at the 10th location of a 1 dimensional random walk given the starting location and that the random walk ends if it reaches the 0th or 10th location.\n",

    "Here, write a function called `random_walk` that takes two parameters: `start` and `end`.  The function should return the number of steps it takes to reach the `end` location starting from the `start` location. The moves are either +1 or -1 on a one dimensional \"track\". For example, if you start at 6, a random move would move you either to 5 or 7. The random walk ends if it reaches the `end`. The random_walk function should return the number of steps taken. \n",

Print out that average and standard deviation. (Hint: It's easier if you use arrays to store the number of steps it takes to reach the end location for each of the 100 random walks.  Then you can use the np.mean and np.std functions to calculate the average and standard deviation.)\n",

Set the number of walks to 100 (instead of the 1000 as done in the lecture notes). Follow the lecture notes and calculate the diffusion coefficient. You don't need to plot the random walk, but you will plot the average squared distance versus the number of steps just like in the lecture. You'll then calculate the diffusion coefficient given the values used in the lecture. Print out the resulting diffusion coefficient.\n",
