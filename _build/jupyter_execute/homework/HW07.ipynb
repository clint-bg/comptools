    "This problem reviews the use of non-linear solvers. You can use any numerical non-linear solver. Below is an image of a portion of a pipe network with pipes label P1, P2, and P3. Fluid enters the left and then exits at the right through both P2 and P3. Each of those pipes have different properties (lengths, diameters, and roughness).\n",
