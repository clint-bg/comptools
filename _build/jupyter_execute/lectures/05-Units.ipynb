    "Units must be annotated in your code. You can use the standard SI units, or you can use the [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to annotate your units. The pint package is more flexible, but it is also more complicated. I recommend you annotate your units at each step and define unit conversions at the end of your code. This will make it easier to debug your code."

For example, if I'm working in SI units, I could write the following code and know that the final answer is also in SI units.  The SI units are m, kg, s, K, mol.
