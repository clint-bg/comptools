    "# 05-More Equation Solving\n",
    "Systems of equations, whether linear or non-linear, coupled or non-coupled come up in many different chemical engineering applications.  In this notebook, we will practice more solving systems of equations using Python and SymPy."

    "### Non-linear Equations\n",
    "Non-linear equations have terms with exponents other than 1 or functions of variables like $\\sin(x)$ or $\\exp(x)$. $y = 2x^2 + 3$ or $y=sin(x)$ are both non-linear equations. Most of the equations you'll encounter in chemical engineering are non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Equations\n",
    "Linear equations have variables that are not raised to a power and are not functions of variables.  For example, $y = 2x + 3$ is a linear equation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coupled Equations\n",
    "Couple equations are equations that have variables in common.  For example, $y = 2x + 3$ and $y = 3x + 2$ are coupled equations because they both have $x$ and $y$ in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-coupled Equations\n",
    "Non-coupled equations do not have variables in common.  For example, $y = 2x + 3$ and $z = 3p + 2$ are non-coupled equations because they do not have any variables in common."
