# 263 Computation Tools Site

Computational tools are essential in chemical engineering.  This course will introduce you to some of the tools you will use as you succeed in your academic and professional career. The class, hopefully, will also help you think critically and creatively about how to use these tools to solve problems. Additionally, course content will help grow your faith in Jesus Christ and to follow His example and the words of His prophets.
