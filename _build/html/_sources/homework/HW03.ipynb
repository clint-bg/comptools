Don't just call math.factorial inside the function, you have to write the loop yourself), test it out by running it with starting values of 5, 10, and 20. Print out the results with the comparison to the math.factorial function.\n",

    "## Problem 2: While Loop (3 points)\n",
    "In the lecture we used a while loop to estimate the probability of a random walk ending at the 10th location of a 1 dimensional random walk given the starting location and that the random walk ends if it reaches the 0th or 10th location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, write a loop titled `random_walk` that uses two parameters: `start` and `end`.  The loop should return the number of steps it takes to reach the `end` location starting from the `start` location. The moves are either +1 or -1 on a one dimensional \"track\". For example, if you start at 6, a random move would move you either to 5 or 7. The random walk ends if it reaches the `end`. The random_walk function should return the number of steps taken. \n",

    "Run your loop 100 times and calculate the average and standard deviation of the number of steps it takes to reach the `end` location starting from the `start` location, given a start location of 12 and an end location of 18.  Print out that average and standard deviation. (Hint: It's easier if you use arrays to store the number of steps it takes to reach the end location for each of the 100 random walks.  Then you can use the np.mean and np.std functions to calculate the average and standard deviation.)\n",

    "## Problem 3: Nested Loops (4 points)\n",
    "In class, we wrote a nested loop to calculate the diffusion coefficient of a particle undergoing a random walk.  The inner loop was for a given 'walk' with a certain number of steps. The outer loop was to loop over the total number of random walks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, modify the code given in class to include a third dimension z. Instead of only being able to move in x or y each step, now the particle can move in x,y,or z. Set the number of walks to 100 (instead of the 1000 as done in the lecture notes). Follow the lecture notes and calculate the diffusion coefficient. You don't need to plot the random walk, but you will plot the average squared distance versus the number of steps just like in the lecture. You'll then calculate the diffusion coefficient given the values used in the lecture. Print out the resulting diffusion coefficient.\n",

    "- You can remove the code that you don't need, i.e. the _loc variables.\n",
    "- Use the slopefit function to find the slope of the average squared distance versus the number of steps. (We'll talk about regression next class.)  The slope is related to the diffusion coefficient."
