        "Imagine mixing liquid benzene (species 1) and toluene (species 2) together in an initially empty container. At equilibrium, some of the liquid from both species evaporates into the vapor phase and some is left liquid phase for certain temperatures and pressures. In thermodynamics, you learn that Raoult’s law may be used to describe the distribution of species in each phase. For the specific example mentioned above, Raoult’s law gives the following two expressions describing the equilibrium state\n",
