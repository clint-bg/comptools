# 16-SolidWorks
SolidWorks is a 3D CAD (Computer Aided Drawing) software package that is widely used in engineering. You'll use SolidWorks to create a 3D model of your choosing (with slight modification of a template) and then you'll 3D print it. The homework will be checked off when you bring your 3D print to class after submitting a pdf image of your associated SolidWorks file.
