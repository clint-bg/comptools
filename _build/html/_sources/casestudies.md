# Case Studies

Now that we've completed boot camp, we'll use those skills (practice those skills) by working in small teams (2 people) to complete engineering case studies where we'll use:
- Literature
- Estimates
- Numerical tools
- Higher-level numerical tools
- and experiments

to better understand several very relavant chemical engineering principles.

Details here on what case studies will be completed and how and when
