# Practice Problems
Your homework, work that you do on your own, is important to practice using the tools you'll use throughout your future chemical engineering courses. 

## Policies
- Homework is due at the beginning of class on the due date.
- Submit your homework on Canvas as a pdf (with the file of interest successfully executed).
- You can use tools on the internet to help you.
- Please don't copy and paste code but type it out.  You'll learn more that way.
- Please work together but remember that you're responsible for your own work and that you need to do that work. BYU's academic honesty policy is applicable.
