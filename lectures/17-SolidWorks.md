# 17-SolidWorks
SolidWorks is a 3D CAD (Computer Aided Drawing) software package that is widely used in engineering. You'll use SolidWorks to create a 3D model of your choosing (with slight modification of a template) and then you'll 3D print it. The homework will be checked off when you bring your 3D print to class after submitting a pdf image of your associated SolidWorks file.

[Helpful Video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ypymT835Gqw) for getting started.

## SolidWorks Software Access

You'll need to use one of the software licenses that BYU owns that is available to you on a CAEDM computer setup with SolidWorks. 

You can use one of the CAEDM lab computers or you can follow the instructions on the CAEDM website to access the software remotely using 'labconnect' for example.

## SolidWorks Basics
Watch the above video or another similar one to get familiar with the basics of using SolidWorks, particularly the sketch and extrude features as well as the shell feature.

## SolidWorks Homework
You will create a 3D model of your choosing using SolidWorks. You will then 3D print your model and bring it to class. You will also submit a pdf image of your SolidWorks file to Canvas. You must create the 3D model from scratch; meaning you can not print an existing model you download from the internet. You can use an existing model as a reference, but you must create your own model from scratch, meaning you use the tools in SolidWorks to draw and extrude and chamfer, etc. the piece.

## SolidWorks Example
In class I will go through an example of drawing and showing a plunger for the 25mL graduated cylinder that you can use in one of the case studies. I won't give you the video or instructions but you could simply do the same thing for your assignment. 

## 3D Printing
There are 3D printing stations around campus. You'll need to export your SolidWorks design to an stl file and then email or upload it to the 3D printing service. The 3D print can easily take longer than 2 hours to complete by the machine.
