# Modules

## Course Schedule
The schedule for the course outlined on Learning Suite. The course is broken up into 2 sections: (1) Python and associated tools, and (2) Excel and introduction to SolidWorks, Aspen Hysys and Ansys Workbench. The course is designed to be hands-on and interactive with a focus on case studies and real-world applications.

## Case Studies
[Heat Transfer](casestudies/heattransfer.ipynb)  
[Thermodynamics](casestudies/thermo.ipynb)  
[Molecular Dynamics](casestudies/MD.ipynb)
