# Case Studies

Now that we've completed much of the course, we'll use skills we've practiced by working in small teams (3 people) to complete to complete two case studies. Each team will select two of the following:
- [Heat Transfer](casestudies/heattransfer.ipynb)  
- [Thermodynamics](casestudies/thermo.ipynb)  
- [Molecular Dynamics](casestudies/MD.ipynb)  

Teams will work together to complete each case study and then submit a write-up of their efforts and results. The intent is to gain experience doing both theoretical estimates and compare those estimates to experimental results. You'll use python in each scenario together with a simulation tool. You'll also collect some data for the experimental portion of each case study.
