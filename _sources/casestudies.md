# Case Studies

Now that we've completed much of the course, we'll use skills we've practiced by working in small teams (3 people) to complete to complete a case study. Each team will select one of the following:
- [Heat Transfer](casestudies/heattransfer.ipynb)  
- [Thermodynamics](casestudies/thermo.ipynb)  
- [Molecular Dynamics](casestudies/MD.ipynb)  

Teams will work together to complete each case study and then submit a write-up of their efforts and results. The intent is to gain experience doing both theoretical estimates and compare those estimates to experimental results. You'll use python in each scenario together with a simulation tool. You'll also collect some data for the experimental portion of the case study.
