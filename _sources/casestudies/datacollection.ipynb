    "For the case studies, specifically the thermo and heat transfer case studies, you will need to collect temperature data. There are a number of ways to do that. Using an ESP32 microcontroller with a MAX6675 thermocouple amplifier is one way that is very affordable and effective. Below is a short, and hopefully effective, tutorial on how to use the ESP32 and MAX6675 to collect temperature data."
