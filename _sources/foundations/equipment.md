## ESP32 Microcontroller with MAX6675 Thermocouple Amplifier and K-Type Thermocouple
The ESP32 Microcontroller with MAX6675 Thermocouple Amplifier and K-Type Thermocouple makes it possible for you to collect temperature data from a thermocouple and send it to a computer or phone via bluetooth classic. The ESP32 is a microcontroller that can be programmed with the Arduino IDE. The MAX6675 is a thermocouple amplifier that can be used to read the voltage from a thermocouple and convert it to a temperature. 

## ELM327 OBDII Bluetooth Adapter
The ELM327 OBDII Bluetooth Adapter makes it possible for you to collect data from your car's OBDII port and send it your phone via bluetooth.
