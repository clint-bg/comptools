# Intro and Approach

Computational tools are essential in chemical engineering.  This course will introduce you to some of the tools you will use as you succeed in your academic and professional career. The class, hopefully, will also help you think critically and creatively about how to use these tools to solve problems. Additionally, course content will help grow your faith in Jesus Christ and to follow His example and the words of His prophets.

## Syllabus
The syllabus is available [here](https://byui.instructure.com/courses/14908/files/1047880/download?wrap=1).

## Learning Outcomes
Learning Outcomes. Students will be able to:
- perform unit conversions;
- ensure dimensional consistency when evaluating equations;
- use a spreadsheet program to perform engineering calculations;
- solve numerical and symbolic problems using computer tools (e.g. curve fitting, integration, solving equations etc.);
- write program structures (e.g. loops, arrays, conditionals, functions) and understand when programming is most appropriate;
- convert problem solving strategies to procedural algorithms;
- make order of magnitude estimates, assess reasonableness of solutions, and select appropriate levels of solution sophistication.

## Course Approach
I'll explain with a parable: Instead of teaching you about all the details of a hammer, I hope to build a house together. During building of the house, you'll learn to use a hammer as well as other tools.

Similarly, I prefer not to take time to highlight in-depth details of the tools we'll use. Instead, I'll show you how to use them as we build something together.  You'll learn the details of the tools as you use them in this class and throughout your education and career.

This approach is called [Just-in-Time Teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_teaching).  It is a form of active learning.  It is similar to how the course has been taught in the past with some minor changes. This approach replicates how a trade can be learned as an appretice.  You'll learn by doing I hope.

Perhaps another example will help. Imagine you have never seen a car, or a car tire, or a steering wheel, or an engine. I would argue that you could learn to drive a car without knowing the details of how the car works. You would learn to drive by doing. You would learn to drive by making mistakes and correcting them. You would learn to drive by watching others drive. You would learn to drive by reading the manual. You would learn to drive by asking questions.

Lectures and modules will review specific examples (some with classroom demonstrations) and the homework will reinforce those examples and introduce specific computation concenpts and tools. Those tools will be used to solve the problem and be reinforced in the class discussions and homework. 

You are at a time when more information is readily at your fingertips than any other time in history. When you have a question, you can find the answer. I expect you to use the resources available to you while adhering to BYU's honesty policy.
