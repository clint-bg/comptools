# Case Studies

Now that we've completed boot camp, we'll use those skills (practice those skills) by working in small teams (2 people) to complete engineering case studies where we'll use:
- Literature
- Estimates
- Numerical tools
- Higher-level numerical tools
- and experiments

to better understand several very relavant chemical engineering principles.

Details here on what case studies will be completed and how and when

## Descriptions

### Cantera
Adiabatic Flame Temperature
Exploding Paint Can

### Aspen Hysys
Canned Air Venting

### Ansys Workbench: Fluid Flow
Thermal Heating of a Rod at one end

I went through a tutorial on YouTube: Ansys Fluent 3D basic | fluid flow through a venturi by Science Roast posted 2 years ago. Aspen Workbench is available on the CAEDM machines.

### CFD: COMSOL
Wall stress and strain in a tank
Need a strain gauge to measure strain (choked flow cart)

### Problems
- OBDII ELM 327 ($7)
    - Vehicle analysis
- ESP32 ($4)
    - Air handling unit (HVAC) analysis
    - Bluetooth data collection of temperature and humidity
- Molecular Dynamics Code
- Heat Conduction Down a Rod
- Venting of difluoro ethane (dfe) from "canned air"

## Demos occasionally
- Flame temperature with ESP32
- OBDII ELM 327 Vehicle Data
- Heat Conduction Down a Rod
