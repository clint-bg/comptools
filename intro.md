# Reaction and Materials Lab Site

Labs that are part of the Reaction and Materials Lab at the Brigham Young University 
 - Build a CSTR reactor
 - Run the reactor as a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and determine the order of reaction and the reaction coefficient
 - Build a PFR reactor
 - Run the PFR reactor and compare the PFR performance to the CSTR
 - Tensile stress and strain with an application example or clear purpose on how it would apply
 - Pressure relief
 - Salt corrosion and corrosion protection
